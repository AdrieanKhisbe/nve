This directory contains [examples](main.sh) of this library.

To execute them, first [install](../README.md#install) `nve` globally. Then run
`bash node_modules/nve/examples/main.sh`.

You can edit the [examples](main.sh).

They can also be run directly [in your browser](https://repl.it/@ehmicky/nve).
